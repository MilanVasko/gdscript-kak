# gdscript-kak
[Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/) syntax highlighting for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) / Godot Scripting Language gdscript.
The syntax support is really basic, doesn't have things like path integrated since I don't even think that's possible.

# Install
Add gd.kak to your autoload dir: `~/.config/kak/autoload/` or to `/usr/share/kak/autoload/`.
It should get loaded automatically now whenever you open .gd files.
